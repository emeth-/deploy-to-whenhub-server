# How to use button

<b>Embed the <a href='http://view-on-whenhub.herokuapp.com/'>button code</a> in any markdown or html timeline (following this <a href='https://github.com/emeth-/whenhub-button-server/blob/master/timeline_format.md'>specific format</a>) you have in GitHub!</b> When button is clicked by you or any visitor, a new WhenHub widget is dynamically created with your latest timeline, presenting your timeline in one of several different beautiful UI views!

You can form one of our example timelines in <a href='https://github.com/emeth-/whenhub-button-examples'>this repository</a> to get started.

# Examples

Head over to <a href='https://github.com/emeth-/whenhub-button-examples'>this repository</a> to see examples of the timeline and button in action. Feel free to fork and customize to create your own examples.

# Deploy your own server

This server has been deployed at <a href='http://view-on-whenhub.herokuapp.com/'>view-on-whenhub.herokuapp.com</a>. All examples assume use of that server. You may instead use the button below to deploy your own version of the server.
